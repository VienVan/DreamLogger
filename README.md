####Unsolved Problems
* We have code for creating/deleting dreams, but have not been able to implement them in the timeline for each separate dream.
* When providing incorrect credentials, the page just loads to an error page. Flash messages would be nice.
* We have access to a dream dictionary and are able to see it in our console, but cannot render it on the page.
* Search bar can only be clicked once and you have to press your tab button a few times to get back to it.
